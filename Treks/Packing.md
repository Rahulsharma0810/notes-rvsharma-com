**Decathlon’s trekking‑gear abbreviations**

| Abbreviation | Full name (as used by Decathlon) | What it means for your gear | Typical items you’ll find |
|--------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|
| **NH** | **Nature Hiking** | Gear meant for light‑to‑moderate day‑treks on well‑marked trails, usually in forest or countryside. | Lightweight jackets, breathable shirts, day‑packs, trekking shoes with moderate grip. |
| **MH** | **Mountain Hiking** | Equipment for steeper, higher‑altitude hikes where you’ll need more protection from wind, rain, and cold. | Mid‑weight jackets, insulated layers, sturdy hiking boots, trekking poles. |
| **SH** | **Short Hiking** | Short, quick hikes (≤ 4 h) where you don’t need heavy layers or long‑lasting gear. | Quick‑dry shirts, shorts, light rain jackets, minimal day‑pack. |
| **MT** | **Mountain Trek** | Gear for multi‑day treks or high‑altitude expeditions that require more robust protection and durability. | Heavy‑weight jackets, down or synthetic insulation, waterproof pants, trekking boots with ankle support, larger day‑packs or bivouac packs. |

### How to use this when buying clothes

1. **Match the hike you plan to do**  
   * If you’re doing a 2‑day forest walk → **NH**.  
   * If you’re tackling a 5‑day alpine route → **MT**.  
   * For a quick 2‑hour walk in the hills → **SH**.  
   * For a 3‑day mountain hike with moderate elevation gain → **MH**.

2. **Look for the abbreviation on the product label**  
   Decathlon tags the clothing with the code (e.g., “NH‑Trekking Shirt”). This tells you the intended use and the level of protection.

3. **Check the material & features**  
   * **NH** items are usually lightweight, breathable, and quick‑dry.  
   * **MH** gear adds wind‑proof or water‑repellent layers.  
   * **SH** focuses on minimal weight and easy packing.  
   * **MT** includes insulation, waterproofing, and extra durability.

4. **Try it on if possible**  
   Even within the same category, fit can vary. For example, an **NH** jacket might be too loose for a short, fast hike, while an **MT** jacket could be overkill for a day walk.

5. **Mix & match**  
   You can combine items from different categories. For a day hike that starts in the forest (NH) and climbs a short ridge (SH), you might wear an NH base layer, an MH mid‑layer, and a lightweight SH rain jacket.
