### Hiking vs. Tracking

- **Hiking**  
  - Typically a single‑day walk on a marked trail.  
  - Light gear (daypack, water bottle, sun protection).  
  - Focus on enjoying the scenery and staying within a safe, well‑mapped route.

- **Tracking (Trekking)**  
  - Multi‑day journeys that may cross unmarked or less‑maintained terrain.  
  - Requires heavier gear (tents, sleeping bags, navigation tools).  
  - Higher physical demand, often involves overnight stays and more complex logistics.
