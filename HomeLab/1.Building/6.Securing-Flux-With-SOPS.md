Why Sops ?

SOPS (Secrets Operations) is an essential tool that encrypts secret data in GitOps workflows. In short, SOPS seamlessly integrates encryption for files pushed to git repositories. It encrypts the value field while keeping the key intact, making the file generally readable while securing the secrets.

## OpenPGP With SOPS

Generate Key

❯ gpg --expert --full-generate-key

Key is valid for? (0) 0
Key does not expire at all
Is this correct? (y/N) y

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

## Migrating to Age From OpenPGP

Age is a modern file encryption tool designed to address the complexity and legacy issues of OpenPGP. Age uses modern cryptographic algorithms such as X25519 for key exchange and ChaCha20-Poly1305 for authenticated encryption, ensuring stronger security and resistance to future vulnerabilities.

Unlike OpenPGP, which relies on outdated systems like the Web of Trust and supports legacy algorithms like RSA, Age simplifies key management with portable key files and removes the need for complex trust models.

Age also reduces risks from misconfigurations by offering minimal options and focusing only on secure, modern defaults. Additionally, Age provides forward secrecy, ensuring past messages remain secure even if keys are compromised, a feature not natively supported in OpenPGP. With its smaller, more maintainable codebase, Age is easier to audit and less prone to security flaws. While OpenPGP might still be useful for legacy systems or email encryption, Age is the preferred choice for modern, secure, and user-friendly file encryption.

Create the Key

```bash
age-keygen -o age.agekey
```

Create Kubernetes Secret

⚠️ It's important that the key specified in the `--from-file` option ends in `.agekey` in ordered to be detected properly.

```bash
cat age.agekey |
kubectl create secret generic sops-age \
--namespace=flux-system \
--from-file=age.agekey=/dev/stdin
```

To Decrypt all the Files those were encrypted using PGP, Use below command

```
sops --decrypt --input-type yaml --output-type yaml manifests/hub.yaml
```

Then Define new age key encryption in .sops.yaml.

```
# .sops.yaml
---
creation_rules:
- path_regex: manifests/.*\\\\.yaml
  encrypted_regex: ^(data|stringData)$
  pgp: >-
    age16rrsy6rhqkj622k504utsu8qjgue0tdp0aggp6j2zggjzz2ddddqn59vaw

- path_regex: talosconfig
  encrypted_regex: ^key$
  pgp: age16rrsy6rhqkj622k504utsu8qjgue0tdp0aggp6j2zggjzz2ddddqn59vaw

- path_regex: kubeconfig
  encrypted_regex: ^client-key-data$
  pgp: age16rrsy6rhqkj622k504utsu8qjgue0tdp0aggp6j2zggjzz2ddddqn59vaw

- path_regex: secrets.yaml
  encrypted_regex: ^(secret|bootstraptoken|secretboxencryptionsecret|token|key)$
  pgp: age16rrsy6rhqkj622k504utsu8qjgue0tdp0aggp6j2zggjzz2ddddqn59vaw  
```

Again Encrypt the FIles with Age.

```bash
export SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE="./age.key"

# Encrypt
sops -e -i manifests/infrastructure/cert-manager/cloudflare-secret.yaml
```

Decrypt the Files, If needed.

```bash
export SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE="./age.key"

# Decrypt
sops --decrypt --input-type yaml --output-type yaml manifests/infrastructure/pull-secrets/docker-hub.yaml
```

### Encountered Errors

While pushing a age encrypted secret to github i am getting below error.

```
pull-secrets	main@sha1:8f4690b0	False	False	decryption failed for 'docker-hub-pull-secret': failed to decrypt and format 'flux-system/docker-hub-pull-secret' Secret data: cannot get sops data key: Failed to get the data key required to decrypt the SOPS file.

Recovery failed because no master key was able to decrypt the file. In order for SOPS to recover the file, at least one key has to be successful, but none were.
reflector	main@sha1:097562d0	False	True	Applied revision: main@sha1:097562d0
```

Further Troubleshooting.

Cross check age.key with secrets in k8s

```
kubectl get secret sops-age -n flux-system -o jsonpath="{.data['age\\.key']}" | base64 --decode
```

Both matched Perhaps i still get the error.

**Solution:**

The key needs to be age.agekey not age.key

```
age-keygen -o age.agekey
k delete secrets sops-age -n flux-system

cat age.agekey |
kubectl create secret generic sops-age \\\\
--namespace=flux-system \\\\
--from-file=age.agekey=/dev/stdin
```
