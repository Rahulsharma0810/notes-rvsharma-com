## Choosing the Operating System

### 🧠 Goals & Considerations

Before installing any OS, I had a few **key performance indicators (KPIs)** and **risk indicators (KRIs)** in mind. I also tested most options before finalizing anything.

**Requirements:**

- ✅ High performance (no resource drain on GUI)
- ✅ Easy Kubernetes deployment via virtualization
- ✅ Full use of RTX 4080/4090 GPU for LLM use/training
- ✅ 👨‍❤️‍👨 Flexing  
  - Control **RGB lights** on fans  
  - Display **CPU temperature** on ARGB cooler screen 
---

### ❌ Windows 11

#### ✅ Pros:

- Plug-and-play support for motherboard, GPU, and accessories  
- Official **Ant Esports** software for ARGB display  

#### ❌ Cons:

- **WSL2 isn't ideal for Kubernetes clusters**  
  - Dynamic disk sizing is inefficient  
  - Static IP assignment is a pain  
- **Hyper-V** lacks proper **USB passthrough support**  
- GUI overhead wastes compute for a homelab setup  

#### ⚙️ Notes on WSL2 Setup

```bash

# ~/.wslconfig

[wsl2]

memory=24GB  # Limits usage to 75% (24GB) of system memory
```

**Manual WSL2 Install:**

```
Wsl --import microk 8 s D:\\microk 8 s "C:\\Users\\sharm\\Downloads\\ubuntu-noble-wsl-amd 64-ubuntu 24.04 lts. Rootfs. Tar. Gz" --version 2
```

Disable auto-mounts with:

```
[boot]
systemd=true

[automount]
enabled = false
```

Installed MicroK8s using Snap, but faced issues managing cluster configuration (e.g., editing kube-apiserver.yaml for certs/IP).


> 💡 **Note**: Tried **Armoury Crate** and **Aura Sync** for RGB control, but both were buggy. Installed **OpenRGB** instead and uninstalled ASUS software. (See: [Awesome OpenRGB](#awesome-openrgb))  

➡️ **Conclusion**: Dropped Windows to avoid wasting hours managing it, save compute power, and due to limited support for USB passthrough.

## **❌ ESXi 8 Installation**
  
Installed **VMware ESXi 8** – basic setup worked, and WebUI was accessible.

However, encountered an issue while installing a Windows VM:

```
Windows cannot be installed: PC does not meet requirements
```

Also, ESXi Web UI showed:

```
TPM 2.0 device detected but a connection cannot be established.
```

Despite enabling TPM, UEFI, and other BIOS settings, the issue persisted.

⚠️ Found online reports about **ESXi struggling with GPU passthrough**, which is a **deal-breaker** for future LLM workloads.

## **✅ Proxmox VE Installation**

Installed **Proxmox VE 8** on a temporary SSD to test **OpenRGB** compatibility.

• ✅ Detected all devices on ASUS ROG X670E-E

• ✅ HyperX RAM RGB working via OpenRGB

• ❌ Motherboard RGB not detected


Tested **USB passthrough** from Proxmox to a Windows VM:

• Installed Armoury Crate & Aura Sync
• **Nothing was detected** by the apps, even with raw PCIe passthrough

> ❗ Even after passing all USB and PCI devices, Windows failed to detect the ARGB controllers.

**🎨 Awesome OpenRGB**

Installed **OpenRGB** on Debian following this [guide](https://pmcvtm.com/adding-openrgb-to-proxmox).

**🏡 Integrating OpenRGB with Home Assistant**

Installed this [Home Assistant plugin](https://github.com/koying/openrgb_ha) to control lighting through Home Assistant → HomeKit.  

> 🎯 Goal: Control RGB lighting via automations or Siri/Shortcuts.
