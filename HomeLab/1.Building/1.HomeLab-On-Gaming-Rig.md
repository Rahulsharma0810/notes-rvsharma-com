I‚Äôve been running my homelab for the last **5 years** on **ESXi 6.7**, with **1 control plane** and **4 Ubuntu nodes**, all running on **Dell Optiplex Tower Servers**.  

For the past **2 years**, I‚Äôve been planning an upgrade‚Äîpartly to get better CPU and memory, but primarily to run **large language models (LLMs)** locally.

After evaluating options, I decided to build a **gaming rig**‚Äîfor obvious ‚Äúpower‚Äù reasons.

I‚Äôm based near **Delhi NCR**, and I found **significantly better hardware prices at Nehru Place Market** compared to Amazon or Flipkart, even during festive sales like Big Billion Days.
