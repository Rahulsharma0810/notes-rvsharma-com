I ran HomeLab from last 5 years on ESXI 6.7 with 1 Control Plane and 4 Nodes on top with Ubuntu on Dell Optiplex Tower Servers.

From past 2 years i wanted to upgrade the system to run LLM Locally as well to upgrade it for better CPU and Memory.

I made the choice to make a gaming rig, because of Obvious "power" reasons.

I live near Delhi NCR area, I have found a lot better prices in Nehru Place Market compared to Amazon Or Flipkart even in big billion or Festive Sale.
