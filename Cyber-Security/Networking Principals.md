Who is this course for?

This course is designed to bridge the knowledge gap between backend engineers, frontend engineers, and network engineers by providing a deep understanding of how networking and backend applications interact.  

1. Backend Engineers

• Primarily built for backend engineers developing applications consumed by clients.

• Many backend engineers don’t fully understand what happens behind the scenes when a request reaches their application.

• Key areas covered:

• How the operating system handles incoming network segments.

• What ports or processes are listening for incoming traffic.

• Why a request (TCP segment) gets directed to a specific process.

• The goal is to remove the “foggy” understanding of networking in backend development and build a strong foundational knowledge.

  

2. Frontend Engineers Moving to Backend

• Useful for frontend engineers transitioning to backend development.

• Frontend developers interact with backend APIs, but often don’t understand what happens after making a request.

• Helps them trace a request from the frontend to the backend, identify bottlenecks, and differentiate between backend slowness and network latency.

• Covers deeper networking fundamentals beyond what’s typically encountered in frontend development.

  

1. Network Engineers Interested in Backend Development

• Helps network engineers who want to build or understand backend applications.

• Many network engineers see everything above Layer 7 as “just an application” without considering deeper interactions.

• Covers:

• How applications handle network traffic.

• Why certain network behaviors (e.g., TCP resets) occur.

• How backend applications interact with networking layers.

• Aims to bridge the knowledge gap between backend engineering and networking.

  

Core Objective of the Course

• Eliminate the black-box perception of backend networking.

• Equip engineers with the knowledge to debug and optimize network interactions efficiently.

• Provide foundational knowledge that applies across backend, frontend, and networking disciplines.

  
If you are a backend engineer, a frontend engineer learning backend, or a network engineer wanting to understand backend applications better, this course is for you.
