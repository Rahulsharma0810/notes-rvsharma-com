The Course Is Presented By Hussein Naseer on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/fundamentals-of-networking-for-effective-backend-design/learn/lecture/31096404#overview)

Anyone who started their CS engineering Directly through frameworks. Engineers most of the time doesn't know what is going behind for example TCP connection, Performance degradation etc. 

So who is this course for?

I specifically built this course for back end engineer like myself who are really building back in applications

that clients consume, but they don't really necessarily understand what is going on behind the scenes.

When a segment arrives at their application, what the operating system is doing, what is the application

is listening on, and why the segment goes to a certain process but not the other.

It's effectively tries to unveil and remove the blinds from this, you know, foggy, understanding

and trying to build a bridge.

That gap, as I talked about previously and also remember that the fact that we're using the word back

and kind of indicate that there is a frontend that consumes that back in and mostly the medium that

connects the back end to the front end is networking.

So really good idea to understand what is happening behind the scenes when you're building these basic

fundamentals.

This course is also very good for frontend engineer who are trying to build back in application or built

back in application before.

Because guess what?

Frontend engineers are those who make the calls to the back end to an API to consume it.

So it's really interesting to send a call and really follow the call all the way to the back end and

make sure that it actually reaches.

So if there is a slowdown in a certain request, it doesn't mean that a back in is slow.

Could be the networking between this point, to this point has certain limitation and it's good to understand

that there could be a configuration in your client side when it comes to the network and is way lower

level down beneath you.

You know it doesn't it's not something you as on the application necessarily without Node.js or Python

as low level is so understanding that and once you really understand is what really matters here when

you understand you know what to do.

When you don't understand, it becomes really a black box and you're just left out with more confusion.

Because also for network engineers who are interested to build back end or frontend applications and

not rendering already understand these basic fundamentals.

You know, some, some of them you don't understand everything.

Nobody does, obviously.

But that gap that we talked about between the application and the networking is really huge.

And you'll be surprised that most of the networking that I met, we don't see the application.

They treat everything above Layer seven as an application, although there are so many other layers

above that, you know, it's not just, oh, why is the application doing sending a reset to the socket?

Well, sometimes the even the back end engineer doesn't understand why is happening, not necessarily.

Right.

So there is a huge gap between the network engineer and the backend engineer and I try to bridge that

gap as much as possible.

Sometimes I fail, sometimes I succeed.

But this is the goal of this course, at least to bridge this gap.

So if you are networking Jews who want to build application and you want to even to refresh your memory

on this kind of thing, I think this course, this course might be for you.
