## 24. Spend a Moment Every Day Thinking of Someone to Thank


Thoughts

As life is a result of coincidences, If something wrong happened in the past even at single time, without the action of ours than the situation must have different now.

Thus coincidence are not in the hands of humans, even when we try hell out of shit. Approx every coincidences in our life play better with me. For example working body, sharp mind etc. and if I want to thanks someone for this, can’t I thank a supreme power, goblets assume god for now. Because we don’t want the ultimate truth.

29. Become a better listener
Research on how to keep track of questions in the conversation, Sometimes generally people loop couple of questions and I stop them to answer them.
